# Progress log and Resource section
## 17 Dec:
* We have been assigned the project: **Human Activity Detection** (using video feed)
* Met Dr. Bishwas:
	* It would be best to limit the frame rate to 5 fps, as beyond this increase in data wouldn't result in increase in useful information.
## 18 Dec:
* Met Dr. Shreedhar for some insight upon our project:
	* First step would be human and object detection
	* Seems like Cafe is a heavily used framework (against my previous misconception)
	* According to him each framework is suited for particular kind for problem, e.g. pytorch for GANs and cafe for when we need speed.
* Started Coursera's deeplearning.ai CNN course by Andrew Ng
## 19 Dec:
* Got access to DGX
## 20 Dec:
* [CS231n Winter 2016: Lecture 4: Backpropagation, Neural Networks 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i94OvYb6noo): I you are like me and have learned most of DL from Deeplearningl.ai course then chances are you might not feel comfortable enough in back propagation. This video by Andrej Karpathy is an excellent resource to brush up this topic.
* Haven't been able to understand the use of docker for server, properly yet.
* **tmux** is used to create sessions in server which can be used to keep a process running even when disconnected. I might consider learning to work with it.
